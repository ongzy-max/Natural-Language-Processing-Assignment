Ritesh Aggarwal,"Booked flight from Delhi to Sydney for my parent and they keep on cancelling and extending flight. When it came for deduction they deducted on same day but now i got fed-up with them as they keep on extending ticket and try to cancel ticket which they send cancellation on.

They can't even tell how much they are deducting and then it will take 3-6 months to refund money in this digital age. They just know how to collect money and make make money from this SCAM. recommend NOT to BOOK AT ALL with them.",mas

KING,"I booked a flight from Delhi to KL on the 2 July. On the same day, in the evening, I was sent an email and my flight had been cancelled.
I rebooked it on the 3 July and after 3 days I was sent another email that my flight was cancelled again!
after calling up, I was told the next available flight is on the 6 August and when I asked for a refund, they said, it will take 3-6 months to come!
WTF man....
Close the airlines down!! or sell it to me! I will show you how to run it !",mas
paul,"Booked a flight with these thieves from Jakarta to Adalaide Australia, 5 days after booking they cancel the flight with no.alternative flight available
I then asked for a refund which they said would take between 3/6months, so now I'm left with no flight and no money to purchase from another airline.
How on earth are they allowed to get away with this is unbelievable and surley illegal, I've also noticed all similar offers have gone too, they are obviously just on a cash collecting scam along with Malindo owned by Malaysia air offering cheap flights that will never take off but they just keep collecting the money.
Do not trust these thieves",mas
Mickey Pearson,"With the E-Voucher Malaysia Airlines is forcing onto their customers for flights and tickets they have cancelled, they are willingly practissing FRAUD, as the value the E Voucher is only a fraction of the cost the new portion of a return segment of the ticket would cost the customer.

Here is an example:
Cancelled return portion of a ticket: Doha-K.L.-Denpasar
E Voucher value Malaysia Airlines gives is: 3,100
Actual cost to buy a new ticket Doha-K.L.-Denpasar: MYR 10,250

Defraud the passenger by Malaysia Airlines: MYR 7,150

It is absolutely shocking that the national carrier of Malaysia is so blatently practissing FRAUD on their clients/passengers and not honoring their purchased tickets, for which the client has already paid in full once before.

These are the corrupt and fraudulent business practices of Malaysia Airlines.",mas

Luka E,"I have been waiting for a refund for a year and a half since the flight was cancelled due to a pandemic. During that time I have been misled, given contradictory information and generic answers that were not in accordance with the questions asked. The most unprofessional service provider, all the other companies refunded the tickets promptly, but Trip and Malindo believe that honest business practices do not apply to them. I was issued a voucher on 11Feb and informed about it in Mid June because I complained that I cannot accept voucher since I am no longer in Asia and there is a ban on non-essential travelling. But for Trip.com and Malindo Air pandemic appears to a blessing, unlike to the rest of us. So when the voucher expires on 11Feb 2022, they will keep the money for the service they have not provided. CHOOSE OTHER COMPANIES. DECENT ONES. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE BOT POSITIVE COMMENTS AND GENERIC COMMENTS THEY ARE GOING TO LEAVE TO JUSTIFY THEIR CORRUPTIVE WAYS.",malindo

I was told by a Skyscanner rep in July 2020 that Malindo would refund my flight and extra baggage by the 15th November 2020, which did not happen. After this date passed, I contacted Skyscanner, the booking agent I used only be told after about 15 phone calls that Malindo had issued me a credit. I have never seen this credit and have been trying to contact Malindo directly for several months to find out about it. I now have decided that I would like to claim my flight and baggage cost on Insurance and I can't even get anyone to provide me with a letter for my insurance which states that I forfeit my flight so I can make my claim. I am so angry with the lack of care and consideration by this airline that I need to write this review. My request is not hard yet it seems that no one can actually assist me.
